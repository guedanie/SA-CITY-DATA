Incentives include but are not limited to education pay; language skill pay; certification pay; car allowance; transportation allowance; cell phone reimbursement; clothing allowance; and shift differential.\t\n",

The EEOC identifies the acceptable methods for a city or state to acquire this information. The City follows EEOC \n",
    "requirements by obtaining the race/ethnicity information from employees through voluntary reporting (self identification) or from visual surveys of its workforce. Therefore, the City cannot guarantee the complete accuracy of this information."
